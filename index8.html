<h1>GENEVA</h1>

<h2><strong> Why i love this town? </strong></h2>
<p>I always lived at the french border since I was born. For me it's the best place because you have mountains, lake, airport, shops... Everything that you could need.Here is a picture of the view of my house.</p>

  <h2>GENEVA AND ITS CHEESE </h2>

<p>Geneva is also well known for its taste of cheese. There is a lot of gastronomy around the cheese. We find Gruyère, Vacherin, Plateau d'Appenzeller, Emmental cheese.... 
As you may know, one of the specialities that everyone loves is Swiss fondue. (also called half and half fondue)
This one is based on vacherin and gruyère. These cheeses are melted in a pot rubbed with garlic and white wine. This fondue is served with bread cut into large cubes.

<h2>GENEVA AND ITS WEALTH</h2>
<p>Geneva is also well known for its luxury shopping. We can find all the biggest brands of jewellery, leather goods and ready-to-wear in the city centre and more precisely in the rue du rhone. 
The world's leading watch brands are Swiss. We can find Jaeger-LeCoultre, Breitling, Rolex, Patek Philippe etc. We can also find very large palaces such as the Beau-Rivage or the kempinski. 
As mentioned earlier, the GDP of Geneva as well as that of Switzerland is very high. There is also very little unemployment in Geneva and wages are much higher. They are generally at least 2 or 3 times higher than a French salary. This gives the population a very high purchasing power. 
Don't be surprised to see an 18-year-old child having an Aston Martin as his first car. This is normal in Geneva. 
The mentality towards the agent is quite different from that of its neighbouring countries. </p>
